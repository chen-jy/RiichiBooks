# Riichi Book 1 (Printable)
This is a print-ready version of Daina Chiba's *Riichi Book 1*. It is formatted for A5 paper and is about 300 pages long.

Above is the physical cover of the book I printed for personal use. The cover photo was removed (for the print only; it is still present in the source), because I thought the resolution would be too low to look nice. Below is an example of what the interior looks like. I chose to print in colour, but black and white ink should be fine as well, since akadora have already been labelled with "Red".

## Compiling the source
I have made this repository compatible with Overleaf for convenience. Simply upload all the files in the repo into a blank project and change the compiler to "LaTeX". It should compile within the time limit for free accounts.
